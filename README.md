---

# ⚠️ Important Testing & Environment Notes

**Testing Environment Disclaimer:**

This deployment solution has been **tested and validated on local PC environments** using:
- Docker Desktop with Kubernetes (Windows/macOS)
- Minikube (Linux/Windows/macOS)
- Local development setups

**Important Considerations:**

- ✅ **Local Development**: Fully tested and working on local PC environments
- ⚠️ **Production Cloud**: This solution is designed for local development and testing. For production cloud deployments (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.), you may need to:
  - Adjust ingress controller configurations for cloud load balancers
  - Configure cloud-specific storage classes for persistent volumes
  - Update network policies and security groups
  - Modify DNS and certificate management for public domains
  - Review resource limits and scaling configurations
- 📝 **Adaptation Required**: While the core CI/CD pipeline and Helm charts are production-ready, cloud-specific infrastructure components may require customization
- 🔒 **Security**: Review and adapt security configurations (RBAC, network policies, secrets management) for your specific cloud environment

**Recommendation**: Use this as a foundation and adapt it to your specific cloud provider's requirements and best practices.

**What they provide:**
- ✅ Basic n8n deployment to Kubernetes
- ✅ Configurable values for n8n settings
- ✅ Ingress, persistence, and service configuration
- ✅ Support for scaling and worker nodes
- ✅ Redis integration for queue mode

**What they don't provide:**
- ❌ CI/CD automation
- ❌ Multi-environment support
- ❌ GitOps integration
- ❌ Custom Docker image building
- ❌ Automated security scanning
- ❌ Branch-based deployment strategy

## 🌿 Branch Structure

This repository uses a **three-branch structure** for multi-environment deployment:

- **`develop`** → Deploys to **dev** environment
- **`uat`** → Deploys to **UAT** environment  
- **`main`** → Deploys to **production** environment

**All three branches are pre-created** in this repository. The CI/CD workflow and Argo CD applications are configured to use this structure:

- **CI/CD Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml`) triggers on pushes to `develop`, `uat`, and `main`
- **Argo CD Applications** (`argo/n8n-*.yaml`) monitor their respective branches for changes
- **Branch Promotion Flow**: `develop` → `uat` → `main` (via pull requests)

**Note**: If you prefer a different branch structure, you'll need to update:
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml` (workflow branch triggers)
- `argo/n8n-dev.yaml`, `argo/n8n-uat.yaml`, `argo/n8n-prod.yaml` (targetRevision)

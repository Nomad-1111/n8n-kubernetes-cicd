# CodeQL Security Analysis Workflow
# ============================================================================
# This workflow runs CodeQL analysis on pull requests to detect security
# vulnerabilities in the codebase. Results are uploaded to GitHub Security tab.
# This workflow is non-blocking and will not prevent merges or deployments.

    steps:

      # Step 3: Autobuild (optional)

      # For n8n, this may not be necessary if we're just scanning config files
